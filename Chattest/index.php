                    Welcome to Chattest!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chattest is a rapidly-evolving free online chat service,
                    currently in its early stages. Our primary goal at Chattest
                    is to provide a place where people who are feeling a bit lonely
                    can come together and enjoy each others' online company for a
                    chat about whatever may be on their minds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Chattest is currently an experimental service that will continue
                    to grow organically over time to better suit the needs of our
                    users. Feedback from users to the development team is highly
                    encouraged, as our goal is also to promote an online service
                    that strives to work with the user to create a better chat
                    experience together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Chattest was created and is based in Canada, but is open to
                    English speakers from any part of the world. The site is
                    supported by minimal ad content, so registration and use
                    are both completely free.
                </p>

                <p>
